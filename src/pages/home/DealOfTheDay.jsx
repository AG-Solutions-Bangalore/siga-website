            South India Garment Association (SIGA) was formed more than a decade ago. The vision behind its formation was to create a platform for manufacturers, distributors, agents as well as retail traders. With its inception in Bangalore, the gateway to the southern, SIGA grabbed the opportunity to establish the emerging market as the focal point of growth of not only the market in Bangalore but also the state and eventually the region.
